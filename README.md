### Swift Image Caching

This is a small app that demonstrates the implementation of an image service that downloads the images and does different kinds of caching, mainly in-memory and on-disk caching.

## How To Run

The app doesn't use any third party libraries or frameworks, so you can just easily clone the repo and compile the `master` branch.
